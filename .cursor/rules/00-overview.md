## About the project

This project is a web based application built using Go and static HTML. It serves as a platform for parents to generate simple maths for their children in **elementary school** to practice. The application allows users to select the type of maths operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and the number of questions they want to generate. The generated questions are displayed in a printable format. No login or personal information is required to use the application.

I intend to make it free to users and use Google AdSense to generate revenue.
